# PointOfSale

 I am provided with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) where the user/customer will input the numeric barcode for each item they want to purchase and the items will be displayed along with their prices. 
 
 Items can have sales tax, discounts, bottle deposits, and more so your software will have some work to do to compute the final price of each item.
 
I develop this software without the use of conditionals.
